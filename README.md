Looking at the potential disruption of AI in society.

The potential impacts of machine learning will very likely be profound on society. One possible analysis might be that the jobs that require the least qualifications are most at risk. I used data from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics https://www.bls.gov/ooh/occupation-finder.htm to overview potential impacts.

The data was first filtered via positions that required the least qualifications. After reviewing the data, and seeing roles such as actors and athletes I also filted the data based on below median wage.
